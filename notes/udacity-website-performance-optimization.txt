CRP - Critical Rendering Path

CSS link - blocks rendering and JavaScript execution
JavaScript - blocks parser (unless it is external link with async)

CRP metrics:
- number of critical resources
- number of critical bytes
- minimum critical path length

browsers have preload scanner which can discovery other CSS and JavaScipt links (in order to start downloading them) even though parser is blocked (by other JavaScript)

Measure first then optimize.
